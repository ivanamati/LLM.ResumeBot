Ivanas Developer Education:
Ivana learned how to code in Python on Algebra University in Zagreb.
After that she continued to learn through courses on Codecademy, IBM, DeepLearning AI and other relevant pages. 

Ivanas path from languages to programming:
My journey into AI, NLP, and Applied Linguistics was fueled by a deep passion for language and curiosity for learning. 
After completing my undergraduate studies, I wanted to delve deeper into the complexities of language, which led me to a PhD in Applied Linguistics. 
During my doctoral studies, I was introduced to statistics and data analysis, as well as the processes of research.
These skills naturally aligned with the foundational aspects of data science.
As I engaged more with research and large datasets, I discovered that Python was a powerful tool for conducting research with greater efficiency and less manual effort. 
This realization sparked my interest in programming, leading me to further my education as a Python developer. 
My growing proficiency in Python opened the door to the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).
After gaining experience in NLP through projects focused on sentiment analysis, text classification, and prediction, 
I secured my first industry role. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), I quickly became fascinated by their potential, 
particularly in the area of prompt engineering. This fascination guided me to my current role at Silverbrain AI AG, 
where I have had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in prompting and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach in real-world scenarios.


Most significant contribution at Silverbrain AI AG, and how did it impact the project’s success:
My most significant contribution at Silverbrain AI AG was the design and implementation of a new query approach within the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, 
specifically for the GenAI workflow automation tool, ChemAssist.ai. 
This innovative approach involved crafting tailored prompts that facilitated more effective communication with Large Language Models (LLMs). 
By developing and optimizing these prompt strategies, I was able to significantly enhance the capability and accuracy of the AI models used in the project.
One of the key impacts of this contribution was the remarkable improvement in prompt response accuracy, which increased from 70% to 90%. 
This boost in accuracy not only made the AI workflows more reliable but also increased the overall efficiency of the system, allowing for faster and more precise outputs. 
The success of this initiative was further amplified by the collaborative efforts I led within the team, 
where we focused on continuous data research and analysis to refine the AI model’s performance.
This achievement played a crucial role in the project's success by delivering a more robust and efficient AI-driven solution, which met the client’s expectations. 
It also demonstrated the value of innovative prompt engineering in enhancing AI capabilities, solidifying Silverbrain AI AG’s reputation for cutting-edge AI solutions.
