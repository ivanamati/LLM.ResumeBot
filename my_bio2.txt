How background in linguistics is complementing Ivanas work in AI and prompt engineering:
My background in linguistics provides a unique and valuable perspective in AI and prompt engineering. 
Linguistics has given me a deep understanding of language structures, semantics, and syntax, which is crucial when working with NLP models. 
This knowledge allows me to craft more effective and nuanced prompts, ensuring that AI systems interpret and generate language more accurately and naturally.
Additionally, my experience in applied linguistics has equipped me with strong research skills, critical thinking, 
and a methodical approach to problem-solving. These skills are directly applicable to AI and data science, where precision and analytical rigor are essential.
By combining my linguistic expertise with technical skills in AI, I am able to bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding, 
creating more efficient and effective AI-driven solutions.


Ivanas Developer Education:
Ivana learned how to code in Python on Algebra University in Zagreb.
After that she continued to learn through courses on Codecademy, IBM, DeepLearning AI and other relevant pages. 

Ivanas path from languages to programming:
My journey into AI, NLP, and Applied Linguistics was fueled by a deep passion for language and curiosity for learning. 
After completing my undergraduate studies, I wanted to delve deeper into the complexities of language, which led me to a PhD in Applied Linguistics. 
During my doctoral studies, I was introduced to statistics and data analysis, as well as the processes of research.
These skills naturally aligned with the foundational aspects of data science.
As I engaged more with research and large datasets, I discovered that Python was a powerful tool for conducting research with greater efficiency and less manual effort. 
This realization sparked my interest in programming, leading me to further my education as a Python developer. 
My growing proficiency in Python opened the door to the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).
After gaining experience in NLP through projects focused on sentiment analysis, text classification, and prediction, 
I secured my first industry role. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), I quickly became fascinated by their potential, 
particularly in the area of prompt engineering. This fascination guided me to my current role at Silverbrain AI AG, 
where I have had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in prompting and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach in real-world scenarios.


Most significant contribution at Silverbrain AI AG, and how did it impact the project’s success:
My most significant contribution at Silverbrain AI AG was the design and implementation of a new query approach within the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, 
specifically for the GenAI workflow automation tool, ChemAssist.ai. 
This innovative approach involved crafting tailored prompts that facilitated more effective communication with Large Language Models (LLMs). 
By developing and optimizing these prompt strategies, I was able to significantly enhance the capability and accuracy of the AI models used in the project.
One of the key impacts of this contribution was the remarkable improvement in prompt response accuracy, which increased from 70% to 90%. 
This boost in accuracy not only made the AI workflows more reliable but also increased the overall efficiency of the system, allowing for faster and more precise outputs. 
The success of this initiative was further amplified by the collaborative efforts I led within the team, 
where we focused on continuous data research and analysis to refine the AI model’s performance.
This achievement played a crucial role in the project's success by delivering a more robust and efficient AI-driven solution, which met the client’s expectations. 
It also demonstrated the value of innovative prompt engineering in enhancing AI capabilities, solidifying Silverbrain AI AG’s reputation for cutting-edge AI solutions.


Work Experience:
Ivana has a diverse and impactful career in the field of AI, NLP, and linguistics, spanning various roles and industries. 
She currently works as a Team Lead Prompt Engineer & Data Science Intern at Silverbrain AI AG in Switzerland, 
where she has made significant contributions by designing innovative query approaches and optimizing prompt design. 
These efforts have led to a notable improvement in AI model accuracy (70 to 90%), demonstrating her ability to drive meaningful results within short period of engagement on the project.
Before that role, Ivana worked as a Language Data Engineer & Data Analyst on a project focused on developing an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for the Croatian language for a Big Tech famous Voice Assistant and Dictation toll. 
In this role, she was responsible for data analysis, model training, and the application of advanced NLP techniques, 
showcasing her strong technical skills and expertise in language processing.
In addition to her technical roles, Ivana has also been a Language Lecturer at the Faculty of Economics & Business in Zagreb, where she has been instrumental in developing language learning materials and planning curriculums. Her commitment to education is further evidenced by her long-standing position as a Board Member & Primary School Department Leader with the National Association of German Language Professionals, where she organizes conferences and delivers plenary lectures on language education.

Technical Skills and some libraries that Ivana works with:
Python, NLTK, SpaCy, Regular Expressions, OCR, Pattern Recognition, Gensim, Pandas, Numpy, Text Preprocessing, Git, Command Line, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Azure, AWS, ChatGPT, HuggingFace, Streamlit, SQL/SQLAlchemy,  Command Line/Gitbash, SPSS

My Prompt Engineering skills and techniques:
One of the most challenging situation in prompt engineering was LLM hallucination. 
Preventing hallucinations in AI models like GPT involves careful prompt engineering. There are some techniques that help reduce hallucinations
and i'm the biggest fan of RAG approach aswell as combining RAG with other prompt techniques like Few-Shot-Prompting, Explicit Context Specifications, well managed and designed structure of prompt or steps for LLM to follow. 
In this techniques linguistical but also technical knowledge of LLM's provided me with skills that helped me and my team to achieve this significant AI based model accuracy and improvement.
